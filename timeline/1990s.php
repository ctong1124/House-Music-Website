              <p>In the 1990s, house continued to catch on throughout the United States. 
                Clubs dedicated to house music began to pop up in Boston, San Francisco and LA, 
                with a similar inclusive and joyous style of those originally in Chicago. 
                With the clubs came a slew of new DJs dedicated to bringing the House spirit 
                to their towns and new producers building and adapting to form distinctive 
                regional sounds.</p>

                      San Francisco in the 1990’s was known as the mecca of the rave scene 
                      in America. Taking the same DIY sensibility as the UK scene, but 
                      incorporating a much more psychedelic San Francisco vibe. Outdoor 
                      parties, warehouse raves and psychedelic drugs fueled the scene 
                      in that decade, making it legendary.

                         Jewel's Catch One is one of the oldest danceclubs in the United States. 
                         It started as a disco club but transitioned to play house music by the 80s and 90s.

                     Much has been said about the great nightclubs in the early days 
                     of House music in Chicago, New York, and Detroit, but less well-known
                      is the story of a space in Boston known as The Loft, a members-only 
                      club on an unassuming side street in the South End, where a generation 
                      of DJs learned the ropes and a unique community was forged. The Loft 
                      was opened in the mid-’80s and – until its closure in 1995 – the club 
                      operated in much the same way as the Music Box, the Paradise Garage, 
                      and the Warehouse, bringing together people from all walks of life 
                      around a burgeoning form of underground dance music called house.
