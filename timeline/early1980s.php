            <p>The Warehouse was a club established in 1977 by Robert Williams 
              in Downtown Chicago. It was a small club with an underground scene, 
              mostly popularized by the music being played by resident DJ Frankie 
              Knuckles. </p>

            <p>The club was mostly frequented by misfits of that time. It was one of the few places in Chicago 
            where black/latino minorities and members of the gay community could peacefully coexist with
            straight kids and have a good time.</p>

            <p>At first, the music Frankie Knuckles started spinning at the Warehouse 
              wasn’t house. He mostly played old disco, soul, funk and R&B tracks that had a common theme:
              they made people want to dance. The club became famous for its music, the types of tracks 
              Frankie was playing quickly caught on and people wanted to hear more.  </p>
